- **Status**: Complete
- **Key Findings**:
  - Feature completeness: ~60-70% across all sprints
  - Critical gaps: Offline sync, placeholder replacements, geofencing integration
  - Technical debt: Mock data, incomplete UI forms, missing test coverage
  - Accessibility: Needs comprehensive audit

#### ✅ PM AGENT (Complete)
- **Output**: `docs/BMAD_PROJECT_PLAN.md`
- **Status**: Complete
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - 6-sprint breakdown (S2-S6 completion)
  - 52 tasks prioritized (P0-P3)
  - Timeline estimate: ~9 weeks with parallel streams
  - Resource allocation plan
  - Risk assessment

#### ✅ SCRUM MASTER AGENT (Complete)
- **Output**: `docs/BMAD_USER_STORIES.md`
- **Status**: Complete
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - 5 detailed user stories for highest priority tasks

## Active Work Items

### Recently Completed ✅

**Story S2-5: Complete Offline Sync for Daily Entries** ✅ COMPLETE
- Database schema updated with sync_status and server_id
- Sync down (server → local) implemented
- Sync up (local → server) with error handling
- Network monitoring with auto-sync on reconnect
- UI sync status indicators added
- Offline-first save functionality working

### Next Up: DEVELOPER AGENT

**Priority Order** (P0 first):
1. **S6-1**: Replace PostHog Placeholder (6h) - P0 blocking production
2. **S6-2**: Replace Sentry Placeholder (6h) - P0 blocking production
3. **S2-1**: Complete Daily Entry Form UI (8h) - P1 user-facing
4. **S3-2**: Replace Dashboard Mock Data (8h) - P1 user-facing

**Current Focus**: Moving to S6-1 (PostHog) and S6-2 (Sentry) as they block production deployment

---

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- None - Ready to begin development

### Dependencies
- S2-5 (Offline Sync) → Blocks all offline-first features
- S6-1, S6-2 (Placeholder Replacements) → Blocks production deployment
- S3-2 (Dashboard Data) → Blocks sponsor portal completion

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Offline Sync Strategy**: Last-write-wins initially, conflict resolution in Phase 2
2. **Analytics Privacy**: Anonymous IDs only, no PII tracking
3. **Error Tracking Privacy**: PII redaction required, no user content logging
4. **Test Coverage Target**: >70% on critical paths
5. **Accessibility Standard**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance

---

## Artifacts Generated

- ✅ `docs/BMAD_REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive requirements analysis
- ✅ `docs/BMAD_PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Prioritized project plan with timeline
- ✅ `docs/BMAD_USER_STORIES.md` - Detailed user stories for top 5 tasks
- ✅ `docs/BMAD_CONTEXT.md` - This file (shared context)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Developer Agent** should:
   - Start with S2-5 (Offline Sync) - highest priority blocking task
   - Follow user story acceptance criteria
   - Update `docs/BMAD_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` as work completes

2. **QA Agent** (after development):
   - Test implemented features
   - Document results in `docs/BMAD_TEST_REPORT.md`
   - Verify acceptance criteria met

3. **Repeat Cycle**: Continue Developer → QA cycle for remaining stories

---

## Notes & Observations

- **Codebase Status**: Solid foundation, ~60-70% complete
- **Biggest Gaps**: Offline sync, UI form completions, placeholder replacements
- **Timeline**: ~9 weeks estimated for S2-S6 completion
- **Risk Areas**: Offline sync complexity, geofencing background tasks, RLS testing
