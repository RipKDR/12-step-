## 2. Technical Debt Inventory

### High Priority

1. **Placeholder Implementations** (Blocks production deployment)
   - PostHog analytics: Uses `console.log` instead of actual tracking
   - Sentry error tracking: Uses `console.log` instead of actual error capture
   - Encryption: Uses base64 encoding instead of libsodium
   - **Impact**: No real observability or security for messages
   - **Effort**: Medium (requires package installation + configuration)

2. **Offline Sync Incomplete** (Blocks offline-first functionality)
   - Location: `apps/mobile/lib/sync.ts`
   - TODOs for storing steps, daily entries, plans, routines in local DB
   - `lastSync` not persisted
   - **Impact**: App doesn't work offline as designed
   - **Effort**: High (requires full sync implementation)

3. **Mock Data in Production Code** (Blocks real functionality)
   - Web dashboard uses mock data (`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - Sponsees page uses real tRPC but dashboard doesn't
   - **Impact**: Dashboard shows fake data
   - **Effort**: Low (replace mock with tRPC calls)

4. **Geofencing Not Integrated** (Feature doesn't work)
   - Task defined but not registered on app startup
   - No UI for starting/stopping geofencing
   - **Impact**: Geofencing feature is non-functional
   - **Effort**: Medium (app startup integration + UI)

### Medium Priority

5. **Missing Test Coverage** (Quality risk)
   - Test structure exists but minimal actual tests
   - Only one example test found (`Button.test.tsx`)
   - **Impact**: No confidence in changes, regression risk
   - **Effort**: High (comprehensive test suite)

6. **Field Naming Inconsistencies** (Fixed but verify)
   - Previous fix: `share_with_sponsor` ‚Üí `is_shared_with_sponsor`
   - Verify all references updated
   - **Impact**: Low (likely fixed already)
   - **Effort**: Low (grep + verify)

7. **Type Safety Issues** (Code quality)
   - Some `any` types found in geofencing task
   - Missing strict type checking in some areas
   - **Impact**: Medium (runtime errors possible)
   - **Effort**: Medium (type fixes across codebase)

### Low Priority

8. **Calendar Export Not Tested** (Feature completeness)
   - Calendar utility exists but not verified working
   - **Impact**: Low (nice-to-have feature)
   - **Effort**: Low (integration test)

9. **Meeting Integration Needs Testing** (Feature completeness)
   - BMLT/AA integration exists but needs verification
   - **Impact**: Low (external API dependency)
   - **Effort**: Low (manual testing + error handling)

## 15. Next Steps for PM Agent

The PM Agent should use this analysis to:
1. Prioritize tasks based on user impact and dependencies
2. Break down remaining S2-S6 work into discrete tasks
3. Estimate effort for each task
4. Create sprint plan aligning with roadmap
5. Identify parallel work streams (mobile vs web, API vs UI)
6. Set milestones and deliverables

**Recommended Focus Areas**:
- **Sprint 1**: Complete offline sync + placeholder replacements (blocking)
- **Sprint 2**: Complete mobile UI forms (user-facing)
- **Sprint 3**: Sponsor portal read-only views (user-facing)
- **Sprint 4**: Support card features + quick actions (user experience)
- **Sprint 5**: Testing + accessibility (quality)
- **Sprint 6**: Polish + documentation (release readiness)
